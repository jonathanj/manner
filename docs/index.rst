Manner Core
===========

Manner Core is a JavaScript library for managing the validity and visibility
aspects of a schema. It is heavily geared towards complex web forms but uses
standard data structures and is not reliant on the DOM at all.

As such Manner Core does not actually validate web forms or provide any web
components to do so, this is left to the various framework integrations such as
`react-manner`_.
